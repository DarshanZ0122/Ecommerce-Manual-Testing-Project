# How to Log a Bug – Defect Reporting Guide

## Purpose
This document explains the standard process for logging defects during manual testing to ensure clarity, reproducibility, and effective communication with development teams.

## 1. When to Log a Bug
- Actual result differs from expected result  
- Application crashes or freezes  
- UI/UX issues  
- Security or data integrity issues  

## 2. Bug Report Fields
- Bug ID  
- Summary  
- Environment  
- Steps to Reproduce  
- Actual Result  
- Expected Result  
- Severity  
- Priority  
- Attachments  
- Reporter  
- Status  

## 3. Steps to Log a Bug
1. Reproduce the issue consistently  
2. Capture screenshots or logs  
3. Create a new bug entry in Jira/Excel  
4. Fill all mandatory fields  
5. Assign correct severity and priority  
6. Submit the bug  

## 4. Severity vs Priority
**Severity**
- Critical – System unusable  
- Major – Core feature broken  
- Medium – Partial functionality affected  
- Low – Minor issue  

**Priority**
- P1 – Fix immediately  
- P2 – Fix soon  
- P3 – Fix later  
- P4 – Nice to have  

## 5. Bug Lifecycle
New → Open → In Progress → Fixed → Retest → Closed / Reopened  

## 6. Best Practices
- Write clear and concise summaries  
- Log one issue per bug  
- Always attach evidence  
- Retest and close only after verification
